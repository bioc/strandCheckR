Title: Calculate strandedness information of a bam file
Version: 0.99.0
Author: Thu-Hien To & Steve Pederson
Maintainer: Thu-Hien To <hien.to@adelaide.edu.au>
Description: This package aims to quantify and remove putative double strand DNA from a strand-specific RNA sample by scanning a bam file using a sliding window.
There are also options and methods to plot the positive/negative proportions of all sliding windows, which allow users to have an idea of how much the sample was contaminated and the appropriate threshold to be used for filtering.
