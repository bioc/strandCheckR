#' @description Get the sliding windows that overlap a GRanges object. 
#' 
#' @details 
#' This finds the windows that overlaps the positive/negative strand of a 
#' GRanges object. The GRanges object, which is \code{mustKeepRanges} in the 
#' \code{filterDNA} method, defines the coordinates of the ranges in the 
#' reference genome that all reads mapped to those ranges must be kept by the 
#' filtering method \code{filterDNA}. 
#' This method makes use of the method \code{getWinOverlapEachIRange} by 
#' pretending each given range as the range of a read. Since the widths of 
#' \code{x} are not necessarily the same (as normal read lengths), we
#' use \code{nbOverlapBases} to specify the number of bases a window should 
#' overlap with a range of \code{x}, instead of using proprotion as 
#' \code{readProp} in \code{getWinOverlapEachIRange}.
#' 
#' @param x a GRanges object, which defines the coordinates of 
#' the ranges in the reference genome that all reads mapped to those ranges
#' must be kept by the filtering method \code{filterDNA}.
#' @param seqInfo a data frame that contains some key information of the 
#' sequences
#' @param winWidth the width of the sliding window, 1000 by default.
#' @param winStep the step length to sliding the window, 100 by default.
#' @param nbOverlapBases a window is considered to overlap with a range of 
#' \code{x} if it overlaps with at least \code{nbOverlapBases} bases.
#' @return A list of two logical vectors (for positive and negative strand) 
#' defining which windows that overlap the given Granges object.
