#' @title Filter Double Strand Sequences from a Bam File
#' @description Filter putative double strand DNA from a strand specific RNA-seq
#' using a window sliding across the genome.
#' @param file the input bam file to be filterd. Your bamfile should be sorted
#' and have an index file located at the same path.
#' @param destination The file path where the filtered output will be written
#' @param statFile the file to write the summary of the results
#' @param sequences the list of sequences to be filtered. 
#' @param mapqFilter every read that has mapping quality below \code{mapqFilter}
#' will be removed before any analysis
#' If missing, the entire bam file will be read.
#' @param paired if TRUE then the input bamfile will be considered as paired end
#' reads. If missing, 100 thousands first reads will be inspected to test if
#' the input bam file in paired end or single end.
#' @param yieldSize by default is 1e6, i.e. the bam file is read by block of
#' records whose size is defined by this paramter. It is used to pass to same
#' paramter of the scanBam function.
#' @param winWidth the length of the sliding window, 1000 by default.
#' @param winStep the step length to sliding the window, 100 by default.
#' @param readProp A read is considered to be included in a window if at least 
#' \code{readProp} of it is in the window. Specified as a proportion.
#' 0.5 by default.
#' @param threshold the strand proportion threshold to test whether to keep a 
#' window or not. 0.7 by default
#' @param pvalueThreshold the threshold for the p-value in the test of keeping
#' windows. 0.05 by default
#' @param useCoverage if TRUE, then the strand information in each window
#' corresponds to the sum of coverage coming from positive/negative reads;
#' and not the number of positive/negative reads as default.
#' @param mustKeepRanges a GRanges object; all reads that map to those ranges 
#' will be kept regardless the strand proportion of the windows containing them.
#' @param getWin if TRUE, the function will not only filter the bam file but
#' also return a data frame containing the information of all windows of the
#' original and filtered bam file.
#' @param minCov if \code{useCoverage=FALSE}, every window that has less than
#' \code{minCov} reads will be rejected regardless the strand proportion. 
#' If \code{useCoverage=TRUE}, every window has max coverage least than 
#' \code{minCov} will be rejected. 0 by default
#' @param maxCov if \code{useCoverage=FALSE}, every window that has more than
#' \code{maxCov} reads will be kept regardless the strand proportion. 
#' If \code{useCoverage=TRUE}, every window with max coverage more than 
#' \code{maxCov} will be kept. 
#' If 0 then it doesn't have effect on selecting window. 0 by default.
#' @param errorRate the probability that an RNA read takes the false strand.
#' 0.01 by default.
#'
#' @details filterDNA reads a bam file containing strand specific RNA reads, and
#' filter reads coming from putative double strand DNA.
#' Using a window sliding across the genome, we calculate the positive/negative
#' proportion of reads in each window.
#' We then use logistic regression to estimate the strand proportion of reads in
#' each window, and calculate the p-value when comparing that to a given 
#' threshold.
#' Let \eqn{\pi} be the strand proportion of reads in a window.
#' 
#' Null hypothesis for positive window: \eqn{\pi \le threshold}.
#' 
#' Null hypothesis for negative window: \eqn{\pi \ge 1-threshold}.
#' 
#' Only windows with p-value <= \code{pvalueThreshold} are kept. For a kept
#' positive window, each positive read in this window is kept with the 
#' probability (P-M)/P where P be the number of positive reads, and M be the 
#' number of negative reads. That is because those M negative reads are 
#' supposed to come from double-strand DNA, then there should be also M 
#' postive reads among the P positive reads come from double-strand DNA. In 
#' other words, there are only (P-M) positive reads come from RNA. Each 
#' negative read is kept with the probability equalling the rate that an RNA 
#' read of your sample has wrong strand, which  is \code{errorRate}. 
#' Similar for kept negative windows.
#'
#' Since each alignment can be belonged to several windows, then the 
#' probability of keeping an alignment is the maximum probability defined by 
#' all windows that contain it.
